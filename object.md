contents of an object appear in key value pairs enclosed in a curly bracket. Example. 
let people = {
    name:Henry,
     age:20, 
     School:IBT,
     isAdult: true,
}

There are 2 ways to access values in an object
1. The square bracket []; we use the [] after the keys to access items in an object. eg: access the name in the above illustration. people['name']. Note: always remember that keys are interpreted as strings.

2. The period "." we call keypairs in an object by applying period and the key of the objects.eg: access the age in the above illustration. people.age
